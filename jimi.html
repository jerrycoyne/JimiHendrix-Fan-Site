            <h2>The Greatest of All Time in only 27 Years</h2>

            <p>
                James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix;
                November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock
                guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career
                spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most
                influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music,
                and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The
                Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest
                instrumentalist in the history of rock music". Born in Seattle, Washington,
                Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. He then played with Curtis Knight and the
                Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered
                by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the
                Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix
                had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience:
                "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved
                fame in the U.S. after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival
                in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric
                Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most
                commercially successful release and his first and only number
                one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the
                Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970,
                before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on
                September 18, 1970, at the age of 27. (wikipedia)

            <p>
                Jimi's career start date is widely debated. He was active as a musician
                as early as 1962, However he released his first studio album <i>Are You Experienced</i>
                on August 23rd, 1967. It peaked the US charts at #5 but went on to be 5 times
                Multi Platinum with hits like "Purple Haze", "Hey Joe", "The Wind Cries
                Mary" and even more. In 1967 he released <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>(Album Cover
                featured in this section). <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i> further solidified Hendrix
                as a staple of psychadelic rock. This album featured short songs, but what he
                lacked in length he made up for in quality. Songs like "Little Wing" and
                "Castles Made of Sand" helped push this album up to #3 on the US charts which
                achieved Platinum. In October of 1968 Hendrix once again took the world by
                storm with <i>Electric Ladyland</i>. This album busted out on the scene with
                "Voodoo Child", "Crosstown Traffic", and a cover of Bob Dylan's "All Along
                the Watchtower". This was the peak of Jimi Hendrix and the charts showed it,
                <i>Electric Ladyland</i> hit #1 on the US Charts. It also went on to be 2 times
                Platinum.

            <h2>The Legacy</h2>
            <img src="images/jimithegoat.jpg" style="width:400px; height:500px;" />
            <p>
                Almost 50 years after Jimi's early passing his legacy still lives on.
                His unique "crying" playing style to this day is a highly saught after sound
                in the music world. His sound has been tried to be replicated and monitzed by
                many music equipment companies such as Dunlop, who has an effect pedal named the
                "Cry Baby" after Hendrix's unbelievable sound. Along with his musical legacy
                he also carried a civil rights legacy. Before the Civil rights act of
                1964, Jimi was a house hold name and well regarded as a respected musician
                in a time where blacks and whites were still segregated in many aspects of
                life. Many publications including Rolling Stone Magazine have named him the
                greatest guitarist of all time.
